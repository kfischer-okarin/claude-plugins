## TLDR

1. Most prompts are bad because prompt evolution tends to be accretive: we only
   add, never remove, over time. This leads to spaghetti prompts, with
   contradictions and ambiguity. This has real business impact.
2. We need to treat prompt changes as product changes (because agent behaviour
   is product), and treat prompts as code (modularised, MECE, and all your other
   favourite acronyms; refactored if need be & actively maintained).
3. Well structured prompts enable teams to move faster, prevent regressions, and
   have better agents. I propose a very simple structure at the end.

Prompting decisions are product decisions, and using structure to make
unambiguous, maintainable prompts is critical for making great agents. This is
a guide on how to do that.

## Background

I think I have one of the best jobs in the world. I lead Applied AI Engineering
for the OpenAI startups team across EMEA & APAC, and that means that every week
I get to see behind the scenes of the best AI startups globally. And I get
pretty hands on in how I work with their engineers to improve their agents: on
everything from prompts to evals to finetuning.

These startups are advanced. Some have ARR in the hundreds of millions. Some
have their own data annotation teams. Some train their own models.

So it came as a surprise that often, when I look behind the curtains, they have
prompts that just don't make sense. This is not about being beautifully written
prose, or nicely formatted; it's about logical errors that lead to the mistakes
their agents make.

This is not a critique of those startups - indeed, they are more successful
than any company I have ever built, and their teams are full of the best
engineers globally. They are a true pleasure to work with.

But they're leaving huge gains on the table. After only a couple of days
re-writing agents together, I've seen some startups speed up their agents by
50%; others increase 7 day retention by 40%; and still others reduce costs by
30%. These results hold across the LLMs they use, from every provider. When
you're talking millions of ARR & LLM spend, this is pretty material.

Don't believe me? See this
[Lovable engineer's post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benjamin-verbeek_im-an-engineer-at-lovable-and-i-spent-the-activity-7415063883113209856-Nuej)
about how he decreased their LLM spend by \$20M per year… because his mum
caught inconsistencies & duplication in their prompt.

In fact it's because they are so incredible, that I'm writing this. Because
clearly even when you are genuinely world class, our current paradigm for
prompting leads to suboptimal results.

So I thought I would try to scale my impact beyond the startups I can work with
directly by writing this. First, I'll cover why the world's best startups write
bad prompts; then, I'll cover my prompting philosophy; finally, I'll propose a
prompt template.

(whilst reading this, try giving the link to this article to your coding agent,
and ask it to review your repo against this advice + make a markdown file with
its findings, ready for you when you're done!)

## Bad prompts

Given this is so common, there are clearly universal tendencies that lead to
bad prompts. The two key issues are contradictions and ambiguity.

### Our current process for prompting is accretive & leads to contradictions

Most prompts evolve like this: the first engineer building an agent writes a
simple prose prompt. As the startup grows, and the agent is required to do more
things, they add to the prompt. Errors occur, so they add a few lines to fix
those.

The prompt only gets longer.

And no-one reviews the entire prompt end to end. Almost always, that leads to
contradictions in the prompt, because as you add new content, old content
saying something else is kept.

### Implicit knowledge leads to ambiguity

Even if an engineer does review a prompt end to end, they often don't truly
read it. When you read & interpret a sentence, you don't only use the words on
the page. You use all of the knowledge you already have to make sense of those
words. And that's a problem, because you often know what you want the sentence
to say; and you read that, rather than what it actually does say.

This is the problem of specificity: the prompt doesn't actually say what we
want the agent to do, because we haven't unambiguously specified it. For
example, let's say I tell my agent to "never refer to competitors in [its]
output". This makes sense to that startup's engineer who spends every day
thinking about my startup and its competitors. But to an agent without that
implicit knowledge, that is incredibly vague - who are the competitors? What
about partial competitors we also collaborate with sometimes? We haven't
specified what we actually want.

### Conditional prompts compound this

The above problems are compounded by conditional prompts, where additional
prompt content is injected depending on the scenario. Different engineers work
on various parts in separate files. And that means that even if each
team/engineer reviews their prompt for contradictions & specificity, no-one
reviews the whole.

### The outcome?

We get spaghetti prompts. Thousands of lines, with interaction effects between
many paragraphs, and it's almost impossible to review them because by the final
sentence, most humans have totally forgotten the first line. Or got bored and
stopped.

And that leads to agents that "make mistakes", not behaving how the team wants
them to.

But the above is also why I can add value to these startups fast: I do read the
prompt end to end, I've seen themes across hundreds of startups, and I don't
have the implicit knowledge of their team, so I can catch ambiguity and naively
ask "what does this actually mean" with fresh eyes.

After I go through the prompt end to end with teams, there's a beautiful moment
of anthropomorphism. We find many contradictions, and iron out much ambiguity.
And the engineers will often chuckle to themselves that they might have been
unfair, and they say "sorry" to the LLM.

But so far I've just listed problems. AND if we're honest, these startups are
doing incredibly well, so what's the solution? And is it genuinely worth their
time?

The results I've mentioned above speak for themselves financially, but I also
truly believe we can get startups moving even faster and building better
product, which is the startup holy grail.

My principles: start treating prompting as product, and prompting as code. The
solution: making MECE, structured prompts that are maintainable.

## Prompt decisions are product decisions

Agents are at the core of product experience. In chat based products, they are
the entire product. The formatting of the agent's output is the UI. For
example, should it output bullet points? Or markdown?; should it always reply
in English? or in the language of the user's message?

And that's just the output. Agent behaviour is a product decision: should it
err on the side of responding fast? Or do comprehensive research, making the
user wait? Product. Should it call a tool asking for the user to approve
something? Or just get on with it? Product.

It's all product.

So whoever is writing your prompts better understand what user experience you
want, because whilst they might not be writing the UI, they are comprehensively
altering the user's interactions.

And not only must they be able to understand it, but they must be able to
specify it.

My work with top startups, when looking at a specific error trace, involves me
asking 'what do you actually want the agent to do here?'. And the answer is
often 'hmmm, that's a good question'.

If you can't specify the desired product experience, you can't expect an LLM
to give that experience. You wouldn't (or shouldn't) expect a human to.

Each time your engineers add to a prompt, or don't add to a prompt and so leave
it ambiguous, they are making product choices. So making specific choices is
critical for coherent product experience.

## Prompting as code

We use human readable language to get a computer to do what we want. That was
true of programming languages, and it's also true of prompting current LLMs.
Moreover, we've now had decades of experience managing codebases (collections
of text specifying what we want) that grow over time as functionality is added.
Sound familiar? So we can borrow some relevant principles.

### Structure with MECE prompt sections

Engineers please forgive me for using a consulting phrase, but it really is
relevant. MECE stands for mutually exclusive (ME), collectively exhaustive
(CE), and basically means you're covering everything relevant (CE) without
duplication (ME). And that happens to solve the issues outlined above, when we
think about sections in our prompt.

1. Collectively Exhaustive: together, your prompt sections comprehensively
   cover (specify) the behaviour you want.
2. Mutually Exclusive: each prompt section should be self contained, with no
   overlap.

This leads to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) prompts, which are easier to maintain
& review. When you make changes, you change one specific section without
worrying it will interact with content elsewhere. Just like changing nicely
modularised code. And you leave no ambiguity in the desired behaviour. Separate
concerns where possible.

Modular code is good code; modular prompts are good prompts.

For example we will have sections on the general context of the agent, the
behaviour we want, and its output. None of these overlap, and together they
cover the world before the agent runs, its behaviour when running, and what to
do at the end of its run. MECE.

### Aim for the specificity of programming

When engineers write code, they are precise in their desires. If this, then
that. But as soon as it is prose, these same people stop being precise.
Instead, think of it like code.

For example, you might wish to still employ IF ELSE logic. For example, when
describing how your agent uses a web search tool, you might want it to only use
websearch on certain topics. If topic X, use web_search; Else just use internal
knowledge. Or perhaps you always want it to search. Whatever your desire,
specify that.

The aim is NOT to 'program' every eventuality - otherwise you wouldn't use an
LLM. But you do want to specify the behaviours you desire in the core branches
on the tree of user requests, or the rubric for when to do certain things.

### Separation of backend and frontend

Above I mentioned having a Behaviour section and an Output section. In my
framing of prompts as product/code, I like to think of this like separating
concerns of backend and frontend.

1. Behaviour: this is how the agent should act whilst preparing its output.
   It's the way it uses tools, the way it interacts with broader systems, the
   way it plans (or doesn't). In other words, it's like the backend; it covers
   the logic, and the user shouldn't see this.
2. Output: this is the frontend, the user facing part of the agent. What the
   agent outputs could be totally independent of how it thinks. For example
   perhaps we want it to think in very rational, structured ways; but output in
   beautiful prose. Or always use code to do data analysis, but never show code
   to the user.

We separate concerns, which means we can make more consistent specifications of
what we wish under various circumstances.

### Refactor every so often

Even with the best intentions, prompts can get messy. Dedicate some time to
paying down your prompt debt. If new sections are relevant, add them; if some
sections are getting large, split them.

## Template of a good prompt: Background, Behaviour, Output

So we want a nicely structured, MECE prompt, that separates concerns where
possible. The below is a very generic template, which you can use straight
away.

```markdown
# Background – outlines the background for the agent
    ## Aim – high level aim for the agent
    ## Context – e.g. the product it's operating within, key domain specific words that come up

# Behaviour – only touches *non-output* behaviour, i.e. process
    ## Proactiveness – how proactive should the agent be, vs seeking to clarify
    ## Workflow – when the agent does start, do we want it to follow a rough workflow? Plan
    first then act? Or act straight away?
    ## Tool use
        ### Parallel tool use – which tools should be used in parallel?
        ### Tool X vs Y vs Z – specific instructions on when to use each, which doesn't
        necessarily fit into any one given tool description
            #### tool_y – a specific section on a tricky tool and interactions with other tools

# Output – only touches *output* behaviour
    ## Output Format – e.g. specifying we want markdown, no bullet points
    ## Output Rules – e.g. never mentioning competitors X, Y, Z.

(these subsections are examples, but I highly suggest these top and second level sections)
```

A hierarchical, MECE prompt structure that helps keep prompts maintainable &
unambiguous.

You'll notice this is hierarchically organised, like a tree. This helps it be
MECE, and means you can find sections much faster. It also means, if you use an
IDE (like it's 2025 👀), you can nicely collapse the irrelevant sections as you
hunt for the relevant content.

So say I'm having issues with my agent selecting outputting markdown, when I
want it to output XML. Easy - one line change in the Output Format section.

It's unambiguous where that content sits.

## A quick note on evals

I like evals more than the average (normal?) person. Most of the time when
something is going wrong with an agent, a simple eval can help you fix it. But
I think the above is at the core of why.

[Hamel](https://hamel.dev/), whose writings on evals everyone should read,
emphasises that a lot of the value in evals actually comes from when you're
reading through the traces. Half the time you spot the error and realise a fix
before you even write the eval. This is completely true.

But I'd add an extra benefit here: evals force you to decide on what you want.

When you make an eval, whether with deterministic ground truth or a rubric for
a judge, you have to specify the desired behaviour. And half the time you
realise you literally just never specified that desire in your prompt, it was
latent context in your brain, not explicit in the prompt, OR you actually
hadn't clarified it even to yourself.

Evals force clarity, and so they force clear product decisions.

(and go read Hamel for a million other benefits of evals)

## Benefits of structured prompts

### Fewer contradictions

With MECE sections, reviewing the prompt is easy. Each section is self
contained, and instead of having to keep hundreds of lines in your memory to
find contradictions, you just review that section. Moreover, if that section
isn't exhaustive about the behaviour you want, you just add lines there.

### Faster & safer iteration

Separating concerns lets you iterate incredibly fast. When you find an issue,
you just add a line to one specific section, knowing that it should have
minimal interaction with other parts. That lets you move a lot faster.

### Faster search

In spaghetti prompts, you have to remember key phrases in your prompt or the
filenames to find the section to change. With hierarchically organised
prompts, the search process for the relevant sections is much faster (it's a
tree search), so you can make iterations fast.

### Everyone's an engineer

Many forward thinking startups want everyone on their team to write prompts.
This makes a lot of sense: if you're operating in finance, your ex-bankers know
more about what bankers want than most engineers. And remember, prompting is
product.

With a MECE structured prompt, you can get the benefits of that, without
worrying that people without engineering backgrounds will make changes leading
to spaghetti prompts. Because it's incredibly easy to review the prompt change:

1. Did they put it in the right section?
2. Does it contradict with anything else within that section? Instead of having
   to painfully review the whole prompt for interaction effects (or just not
   reviewing it, which is the reality for many teams), you only need to review
   a few lines because sections are self-contained.

### Faster Model Upgrades

When a new model comes out, it's much easier to test its defaults.

1. Perhaps all the 'examples' are no longer needed because the new model is
   just smarter. It now takes 5 seconds to find the examples section and delete
   it.
2. Perhaps whilst a previous model always used to output em dashes, so you
   needed a line in your Output section about that, the new one doesn't. That's
   a one line deletion and a few tokens saved.

So all of this to say: you get a product that actually behaves how you want,
with much less duplication (so lower costs), and that you can maintain and
iterate on much more easily.

## FAQs

### Isn't this just a waste of time if our prompt works now?

No, the payback period is pretty fast. See the examples at the start. And it
will save a LOT of time when your agent starts making very weird and complex
mistakes, because those are the hardest issues to solve in spaghetti prompts.

### As models get smarter doesn't this become irrelevant?

No.

1. Whilst smarter models can sometimes make up for our inability to specify
   what we want, most of the time I don't think they do. A simple test: Ask the
   smartest person you know to write a short note on what they did today.
2. Smart models also don't fix ambiguity: ask them to answer you straight away
   with no clarifications AND to clarify first if your instructions were
   unclear. Did they answer? or did they hit you with a confused expression?

It's a silly example, but it proves the point: higher intelligence cannot
automatically solve ambiguity and contradictions in your preferences. Only you
can (perhaps by talking to an LLM)

So I think with smarter models you can often leave the how less specified; but
you still need to specify what you want.

### Can't we just automate this process and have LLMs write the prompts?

No... well yes, but with a caveat. Meta prompting (LLMs writing prompts for
LLMs) is a great idea. And throwing your system prompt into ChatGPT and asking
it to find contradictions is a great starting point to rewriting your prompt.

But to re-write the prompt with an LLM you have to prompt the 'rewriter'
LLM... and that prompt has to be good. How do you prompt that? With an LLM?...
it's turtles all the way down. Somewhere, you need to specify your preferences
unambiguously, whether in the final prompt, or in the 'rewriter' prompt.

The alternative is to do fully automated prompt iteration, taking some sort of
reward signal and iterating on the prompt to improve that signal. But for that
you need a comprehensive eval/reward model... which needs to specify your
preferences... and we're back to the initial problem. It's harder to set up
this reward system than just write a good prompt.

And either way, there's no free lunch. You need to get clarity for yourself.

### Does this apply to frontier, general agents? I thought they were about loops/graphs?

Yes it does. We have moved to a focus on loops for frontier agents, and in very
general agents it becomes harder to specify what you want in all cases. And we
should rely more on smarter models to handle that, rather than making huge
prompts. But that doesn't mean it doesn't apply. If anything, it means it
matters more: I'll write more about this, but removing content from a prompt is
often an improvement as models get better, so having a prompt you can easily
review and strip down even further is doubly beneficial.

Moreover, even a general agent should have some preferences - e.g. tone of
voice, mentioning competitors etc. And you should specify those precisely. The
same principles still apply, you just maybe leave less specified because you
don't care about specifying it - your requirements have changed.

More 'workflow' type prompts will likely be more detailed, as you specify even
more of the behaviour than a general agent, but it applies for both kinds.
